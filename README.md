Basic Idea:
Explore a universe representation of the itunes store.  

Distinct levels:
Galaxies
Solar Systems
Planets
Moons

Random comets/asteroids will serve as random apps

similar genre apps are grouped together in solar systems, and they can be subcategoried further.  

TODO:
- parse data into a database
- someone create a database to hold the data
- simple server to access the database
- (xcode) build animations for solar systems, planets, etc.
- build logic to organize and sort data into galaxies/solar systems
- need a Name for our team
- learn SpriteKit
- IO between spritekit and server
- Utilize AT&T speech to text API to win AT&T laptops
