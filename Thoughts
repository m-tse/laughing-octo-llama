Ideas for Galaxy

I realize we have a lot of do before some of these thoughts I will be writing down but I just wanted to jot down ideas as they came up

Music in the Background

1) Play sound sample from relevant galaxy
ex. moving from your home -> country galaxy, fade music into #1 country song sample. We can just hardcode this for the demo

2) You can choose whether the background sound is on/off of course

Animation

1) Have a circular boundary in the center of the screen. When you drag a "galaxy" in the middle, the galaxy bursts fills up that circle with smaller circles (planets) representing subgenres or songs
ex. 35:30 of the intro to sprite kit video https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/videos/ except burst from circle instead of drop into rectangle

Text to Speech

1) AT&T API

Extra personalization

1) Get a personal data (use mine or someones) and use that for the galaxy, giving genres similar to your own a higher or more prominent solar system.
Tell apple people might eventually be able to compare systems, explore someone else's system etc. do not have to implement.
